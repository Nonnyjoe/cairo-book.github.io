# Enums and Pattern Matching
In this chapter, we’ll look at enumerations, also referred to as enums and pattern matching.

Enums allow you to define a type by creating a collection possible variants in a sequential order where each possible variant is unique but similar to the others. 
While pattern matching allow you to compare a value against series of patterns and executes code based on which pattern matches the compared value.

First we’ll define and use an enum to show how an enum can encode meaning along with data. Next, we’ll explore a particularly useful enum, called Option, which expresses that a value can be either something or nothing. Finally, we’ll look at how pattern matching in the match expression makes it easy to run different code for different values of an enum.
